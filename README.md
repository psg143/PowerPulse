=======
1.	Data Understanding and Exploration:<br>
○	Load and explore the dataset to understand its structure, variables, and quality.<br>
○	Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns, correlations, and outliers.<br>
2.	Data Preprocessing:<br>
○	Handle missing or inconsistent data points.<br>
○	Parse date and time into separate features.<br>
○	Create additional features such as daily averages, peak hours, or rolling averages.<br>
○	Normalize or scale the data for better model performance.<br>
3.	Feature Engineering:<br>
○	Identify relevant features for predicting global active power consumption.<br>
○	Incorporate external data (e.g., weather conditions) if available.<br>
4.	Model Selection and Training:<br>
○	Split the dataset into training and testing sets.<br>
○	Train regression models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.<br>
○	Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.<br>
5.	Model Evaluation:<br>
○	Evaluate models using appropriate metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, R-squared).<br>
○	Compare model performance and select the best-performing model.<br>
